externalRequests = [{direction, timeStamp, sourceLevel}]

internalRequests = [{destinationLevel, timeStamp, sourceLevel}]


Lift is in rest state at level 0 waiting for an external request.

Scenario : Single request processing.

[{up,155700,3}] //User presses UP button from 3rd floor
	0
	1
	2
	3	    //lift moves up and reaches the level from which the external request came.

[{6, 155720, 3}]	//User enters lift and selects floor level 6

	4		//lift moves up to level 4
	5		//lift moves up to level 5
	6		//lift moves up to level 6

[{down,155740, 9}] //User presses DOWN button from 9th floor

	7
	8
	9		//lift moves up and reaches level 9

[{2, 155780 , 9}] //User enters lift , selects level 2 from 9th floor


	8		//lift moves down to level 8
	7		//lift moves down to level 7
	6		//lift moves down to level 6
	5		//lift moves down to level 5
	4		//lift moves down to level 4
	3		//lift moves down to level 3
	2		//lift moves down to level 2

Scenario : Lift receives multiple requests from a floor

// users get in from level 0 , both UP and DOWN directions are selected.

[{2, 155720, 0}]
[{-1, 155721, 0}]
[{8, 155722, 0}]
[{5, 155723, 0}]
[{1, 155724, 0}]

//All requests are from sourceFloor = 0, sort the requests based on the difference from the sourceLevel

[{-1, 155721, 0}]
[{1, 155724, 0}]
[{2, 155720, 0}]
[{5, 155723, 0}]
[{8, 155722, 0}]

UP:

[{1, 155724, 0}]
[{2, 155720, 0}]
[{5, 155723, 0}]
[{8, 155722, 0}]


DOWN:

[{-1, 155721, 0}]

//Taking into consideration range and timeStamp the lift should go to level -1 (range : 1, timeStamp difference with max(timeStamp) : 3

Lift moves down to Level -1

[{1, 155724, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 1

[{2, 155720, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 2

[{5, 155723, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 5

[{8, 155722, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 8

Scenario : Lift receives another request while previous request is in process.

[{1, 155724, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 1


[{2, 155720, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 2

//When lift is at Level 2 , it receives an external request [DOWN , 155801 , 3] from an user at level 3 to go to level 0
//In this case , since a number of requests are already in queue to go up this request is put on hold and lift does not stop here.
Lift moves up to Level 3
Lift moves up to Level 4

[{5, 155723, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 5
//When lift is at Level 5 ,an user at level 7 presses the button to go up, Since the lift is going up in the same direction as of user request , the lift should stop at level 7.
//User enters at level 7 and presses button for level 9

UP:
[{8, 155722, 0}]
[{9, 155930 , 7}]

[{8, 155722, 0}]
Lift moves up to Level 8

[{9, 155930 , 7}]
Lift moves up to Level 9

Once all the UP requests are completed , the lift goes back to the external request at level 3 [DOWN , 155801 , 3]
Lift moves down to Level 8
Lift moves down to Level 7
Lift moves down to Level 6
Lift moves down to Level 5
Lift moves down to Level 4
Lift moves down to Level 3
